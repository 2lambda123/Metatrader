Ugh... You're in here to *create* reusable code for **trading**,
but instead you're going to *waste your life* reinventing things
like [hashmaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) and
[collections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collection_(abstract_data_type)).
It is the ultimate zen truth in [MQL programming](https://encyclopediadramatica.rs/Computer_science#Software_Development)
to finish
reading the user manual and realize **"There is no framework"**,
not even on a basic level. This is where you meet a
[reinvented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel),
worse version of [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)),
and either quit or think "Well, at least it isn't brainfuck" :
