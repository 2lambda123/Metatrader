# Rayner Teo Breakout Trading Strategy
Notes taken from his video at https://youtu.be/v-Cz_LUsq2g

## Summary
*Often when trading breakouts, price reverses on you and hits the stop. Filtering can dramatically improve performance.*

## Entry
- Look for the long term trend, 200 MA with price above ascending MA, below descending MA, and trade with the trend.
- Identify the area of value, somewhere around support or resistance depending on which direction you want to trade.
  - *For example, you could trade a breakout to the up side by entering on the pullback to support, or wait to enter until after it breaks through resistance. Your decision depends on your metric for evaluating value.*
- Identify the preferred trigger (convergence) and act.
  - *For example, you could set up a trigger on the lower timeframe that scans for higher highs and higher lows to go long, or conversely to short.*

## Exit
- **The breakout does not define your exit**, your value metric and strategy do. A breakout is just an entry signal, not a complete strategy.
- Trend traders would exit on the trend weakening
- Swing traders would exit on the next support / resistance level.
