# Rayner Teo Moving Average Trading Strategy
Notes taken from his video at https://youtu.be/clAQxb-PMSI

## Summary
*Looking to enter on pullbacks while there is a strong trend.*
1. There will be losing trades, no strategy is perfect.

## Identify Long Term Trend
- Using 200 period moving average

## Define the "Area of Value"
- Using 50 period moving average +- 10 periods
- Area of value means an approximate target, not exact.
	
## Entry
- On 200 period MA with MA trending up
- Looking at 50 period MA, with price testing it and then going up again
- Buy on the swing low of the third test of 50 MA

## Stop Loss
- Stop loss is set to a recent low, below the 50 MA or 1 ATR(50) below the entry.
- For trend trading, the stop is set to follow the 50 MA.

## Targets

### Trend Target
- The trend traders target is defined by a trailing stop tied to the 50 MA.
- Trend trader isn't worried about the immediate rejection hazard posed by the recent extreme of price, he's counting on the trend and momentum to carry price through.

### Swing Target
- The swing trader's target would be set just below the most recent high, no sense in fighting against the resistance that already rejected price once.
- Looking to profit from periodic lulz in the momentum of the trend, where the price can pull back to the fast MA and reliably be pushed back up to the recent price extreme.
