## Summary
*Waiting for pin bars is a recipe for disaster, unless you redefine what a pinbar is.*

## What is a Pin Bar

A pin bar is the rejection of price movement that displays on the chart as a candle with a long wick dangling out into the area of rejection. The pin bar will have candles in opposite directions on either side of it. You can find them where price turns sharply, the wicks of pin bars appearing like a smudge on the chart.

Since a pin bar is simply an indicator of price rejection, it may not always form  within the sample period of the candles on your chart. The pin bar may appear as two opposing candles placed one beside another.

## Common Problems with Pin Bar Trading

A common problem with pin bar trading is that the signals will put you in opposition to the general price trend. This is because bullish pin bars often form in bearish trends as price pushes through resistance. The same thing happens in bullish trends forming bearish pin bars while pushing through resistance. These low probability trades aren't a recipe for long term success, because you'll be entering in the wrong direction and targets won't get hit due to support levels being so close to the entry.

## Entry

- Trade with the higher timeframe trend
- Look for confluence with support and resistance levels
- Identify pin bars forming on support levels that go with the trend (price targets that bounce lower on bear trends, or higher on bull trends)
- Definitely don't trade on a pin bar signal alone, it is too weak an indicator.
- Solely focusing on trading pullbacks of the higher tmeframe trend will cause you to miss trading opportunities.

## Conclusion
Pin bar trading is simply entering on price rejection. Price rejection may not always appear as a single pin bar on the chart. Trading price rejection can work in conjunciton with other indicators like trend, momentum, etc. There is no exit signal given when trading price rejection, the exit would need to be calculated by other means.
